## Target Audience

The target audience consists of my professor, whose name will not be released for privacy reasons, as well as any graders. (Hi, Stewart!)

## Prerequisites Before Starting

To begin converting your resume to Github's Markdown standard, you will need a text editor, [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), a stable Internet connection, an up to date web browser, as well as a premade resume.

## Instructions

### How to setup a Github Pages page

1. Create a Github account.
    + After creating your Github account, create a new public Github repository called "<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io", without quotes. This is going to be your Github Pages domain.  
      - You have to replace <GITHUB_USERNAME> with your username, removing the brackets in the process.
1. Install Github Desktop for your operating system.
2. Link Github Desktop to your Github account
3. Link your new Github repository to your local computer by clicking on `Share With Desktop` on the repository page, as shown in image, creating a local copy of your repository in the process.
5. Create a file called `index.md` in your local repository's directory. For now, you can have the text be `#This is my index page!`
6. Commit your file to your repository, and check if it's functional by going to your Github Pages page.
7. Optionally, change your Jekyll theme by going to your repository online, and clicking the Settings tab.
    + Scroll until right before the delete repository option, there, you will find the option to select a premade theme for your Github Pages page. It may take a moment to update your page after saving your settings, so be patient!
8. Afterwards, if everything is working as it should, replace the `index.md` file's contents with your resume written in Markdown.
9. Make a cup of tea.

### Additional Resources

If you've never worked in Markdown before, it's very easy to grasp! You can learn it via a tutorial [here](http://markdowntutorial.com) or you can read a cheat sheet of Markdown's syntax, as available [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)!

## Software Requirements

An up to date web browser that supports the Github security protocol. Netscape Navigator is no longer supported as a result.

## FAQ

#### **Do I need to install Jekyll like how Github Pages tells me?**

Surprisingly, no! Step 7 of the **Instructions** informs you how to have Github change your design for you, if you've never used Jekyll before.

#### **I tried to use a table to organize all of my resume text, but everything is stuck in the first table column!**

Unfortunately, Github's implementation of Markdown prevents you from both specifying the dimensions of the table, nor does it allow for you to merge cells. As such, don't keep all of your content in a table, only the neatly ordered information!

#### **I changed my Jekyll theme, but it didn't update!**

Browsers tend to store old information of how a website looks like in their cache to make it faster to load. You can make them completely overwrite that information by refreshing via Ctrl+F5 on most modern browsers. Also, give it a minute, it has to change a lot of settings before it can make your page look nice.

#### **I changed my Jekyll theme, but the tables are all wonky!**

Some Jekyll themes unfortunately do not properly support tables. There is no easy workaround to this issue.

#### **How do I make an email link in Markdown?**

Surround your email with <> tags to make them an automatic mailto: link.
